# Laravel Sanctum with Next.Js SPA and a Backend with Breeze/Blade

This repo is a minimal example for a Laravel application with the above specifications. 
Note that the authentication in the frontend takes place using axios in a client-side
component. A server-side implementation is, to the best of my knowledge, currently
impossible in this setup.
